Create an application that allows a company to post a new job.

Applicants should be able to search and view jobs that are posted.

Database Layout:

  jobs
    -company
    -title
    -salary
    -location
    -description
    -user_id

  users
    -name

    -description
    -salt
    -encrypted_password

**Path for the search on the jobs/index file is wrong.  
I can't figure out how to define the path in routes.rb.

**Error on beginning steps of attempting to create authentication

***I am going to need to study rails 3 for an extended period of time to work
out the bugs and gain a better grasp of programming in ruby/rails.
